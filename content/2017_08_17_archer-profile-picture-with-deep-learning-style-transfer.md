This is a post about using an interesting technique that is coming out of deep learning, called style transfer,
to make a profile picture for myself using the *Archer* cartoon animation style, to change the look of my profile picture for my company's internal slack channel.

Neural Networks are getting pretty advanced, so much so that they can transfer the style of [one image onto another.](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer) Naturally, I this would be a fun project for me to explore the area of deep learning in Python. Let's go!!

This post will be discussion the most recent papers that have come out in the past couple years, called [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks
](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) and [Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution
](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04802)

How about that for some light reading..heh

So here are the following topics that are the main concepts allowing this type of deep neural network style transfer, and they will allow us to make new art!

## Key concepts for this post:
#### 1. Artificial Neural Networks
#### 2. Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CNNs)
#### 3. Deep Learning
