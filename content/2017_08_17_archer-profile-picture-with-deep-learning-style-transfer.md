This is a post about using an interesting technique that is coming out of deep learning, called style transfer. The aim is to take the nebulous "artistic style" of an image, determine some mathematical representation of this style, and then do an inverse trasnformation to some image to incorporate that style. For my own project, I want to make a profile picture of myself that looks similar to the *Archer* cartoon animation style, to change the look of my profile picture for my company's internal slack channel and my github profile picture.

Neural Networks are getting pretty advanced, so much so that they can transfer the style of one image onto another [like shown in this github project.](https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer) Naturally, I this would be a fun project for me to explore the area of neural networks and deep learning with Python. Let's go!!

This post will be employing some of the methods described in recent papers that have come out, namely [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks
](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) and [Perceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution
](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04802)

How about that for some light reading..heh

So here are the following topics that are the main concepts allowing this type of deep neural network style transfer, and they will allow us to make new art, but also more importantly an awesome profile picture!

## Key concepts for this post:
#### 1. Artificial Neural Networks
#### 2. Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CNNs)
#### 3. Deep Learning
