Somewhat surprisingly, I find that I have a lot more free time now in the real world working than I did during undergraduate study, but that might be because I was doing things like research programs and internships on top of classes. However, now that I have this free time, I have started to follow sports more, specifically the English Premier League and NCAA Football. 

My favorite team in the English Premier League is Manchester United, however I didn't want to have to periodically check online when they play next. So I built a simple web
scraping service with python to parse Manchester United's upcoming schedule and text it to my iphone every couple of days.
