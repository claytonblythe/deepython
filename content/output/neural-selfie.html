<p>In <a href="/category/deep-learning.html">Deep Learning</a>.</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I recently have been trying to learn PyTorch, as it is becoming more popular for machine learning researchers because of its ability to represent complex neural network architectures in just a few lines of code. It also allows for dynamic definition of graphs, unlike its main competitor TensorFlow. This becomes very useful for working with Recurrent Neural Networks for example. </p>
<p>For this post, I implement the Neural Style Transfer algorithm in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576">this paper</a> that takes a content image and a style image and returns a version of that content image with the appropriate "style". </p>
<p>The main idea is that two distances are defined for the content and one for the style. The goal is to transform the image to minimize both the content distance with respect to the content image and vice versa for the style image. </p>
<p>In the implementation described in the <a href="http://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/neural_style_tutorial.html">PyTorch Documentation</a> a pretrained VGG convolutional neural network is used as a base starting point. The content distance is defined as the sum of all squared differences between the feature maps at each Lth layer of the content and produced images, for every ith element of that layer's feature map.</p>
<p>The style distance is more obscure, using a Gram produce of vectorized feature maps, representing the correlation between feature maps at some layer for both style and output images. The gradients for both distances/losses are calculated and summed together, and then backpropagation is done. </p>
<p>For example, we can do style transfer of "Starry Night" onto a selfie of myself. </p>

<p>And here is the result: 
<img alt="Alt Test" src="https://deepython.com/images/starryn_cw0.6.png"></p>
<p>I think that the results are pretty amazing to be honest, however it should be noted that I ran hundreds of different weight combinations for different images, and hand-picked the best results to post on here. I think it has produced some interesting pictures that I plan to use on for online profile pictures. </p>
<p>Here are a couple more results. The first was created using a green spider-web looking image, and the second with the famous "Scream" painting. </p>

<p><img alt="Alt Test" src="https://deepython.com/images/trial_6957597_0.2.png"></p>
<p>Overall, I had a blast working on this project. It was a great opportunity for me to experiment with neural networks and PyTorch. I'm looking forward to learning more! </p>
<p>Until next time,</p>
