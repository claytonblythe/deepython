<p>In order to do efficient work in a unix/linux environment, it is important to get a personalized environment setup to use various aliases, navigate to default directories, and to get your proper path environment setup. This article is meant to summarize the difference between .bashrc, .bash_profile, and .profile files and what I think the best setup is regarding these files. It is standard for these files to be stored in the home directory '~', which is the  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Tilde-Expansion">Tilde Expansion</a>. </p>
<p>It's helpful to think about how Bash chronologically behaves when it is invoked as a interactive login session. When Bash is invoked as interactive, it first reads from the file /etc/profile if that file exists. After reading that file, it will look for a file at ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, and ~/.profile in that order. It will execute commands from the first one that is available if it exists, and it will not proceed unless explicitly told so. </p>
<p>If Bash is invoked as an interactive non-login session, then Bash reads and executes commands from ~/.bashrc if that file exists. Therefore, it is common to include the following commands in ~/.bash_profile, as it is often desired to ensure that ~/.bashrc is executed regardless of whether Bash is executed in a login or non-login session.  </p>
<p>if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
   source ~/.bashrc
fi</p>
<p>So here in ~/.bashrc you can put all various starting configurations like your environment's PATH, and you can source a file containing aliases, like mine is at ~/.aliases. So every time you have a terminal session, whether it is a login session or simply another window, you can have your personalized environment ready for you. </p>
<p>Just to specify, for remote shell logins, like a ssh login, Bash will read /etc/profile and then one of ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile. </p>
<p>For more reading, you can visit the bash manual and user guide <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#Introduction">here</a>, or you can see another helpful guide <a href="https://mywiki.wooledge.org/DotFiles">here</a></p>
<p>I think my setup will most likely include a sourcing of aliases from ~/.aliases within my ~/.bashrc file, which is sourced for every terminal session, either login or non-login sessions. This seems to be a good setup for keeping things tidy and organized. I am open to suggestions and advice if anyone reads this post!</p>
<p>Until next time,</p>
