</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Recently, I setup my own home wifi network with Comcast.. <em>shudder</em> However, it initially hasn't been that bad despite their lackluster reputation. I consistently get 75+ Mbps for my plan that costs $35.00 per month, a decent deal for a basic necessity of mine, wireless internet. </p>
<p>I am a person who has little patience for online advertising. Luckily, I saw this interesting project online about how you can use a rapsberry pi as a DNS server. A DNS server translates human-memorable domain names and hostnames into their corresponding IP addresses. The pi-hole doesn't sit in between your connected devices and the internet, but rather it is a DNS server that blacklists certain domain names, typically ones that host content. As a result, it doesn't allow any content to be retrieved if that hostname is contained within a
certain database of domain names. So, the router goes to the DNS server and says "hey I'm looking for this domain name, what's the IP address?" </p>
<p>This allows all of the devices on your wireless network to enjoy advertisement-free internet browsing! Here are the steps that I took to get it set up. </p>
<ul>
<li>Download the SD Formatter tool software from SanDisk</li>
<li>Plug in a 8gb+ microSD card into a computer (you may have to use an adapter to SD depending on your computer) </li>
<li>Using SD Formatter tool, select and overwrite the SD card to default settings, then quick format the card</li>
<li>Download the latest version of NOOBS (New Out Of Box Software) from the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/">Raspberry Pi Foundation's website</a>. Unzip the file. </li>
<li>Copy the contents of the zip directory to the microSD card that you just formatted. </li>
<li>Safely eject the SD card adapter</li>
<li>Plug in the microSD card into the bottom of the raspberry pi, facing up</li>
<li>Plug the power cord into raspberry pi, hook up to monitor and keyboard</li>
<li>Select Raspbian OS (Based on Debian), hit the "i" key, wait for the OS to be installed</li>
<li>Connect to wifi, then open terminal and copy and paste: curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash </li>
<li>Select the appropriate wireless/ethernet connection in setup </li>
<li>Reserve static IP adress for raspberry pi</li>
<li>Make sure to modify your router's network settings to use the static IP of the raspberry pi as a static DNS server </li>
</ul>
<p>Until next time,</p>
