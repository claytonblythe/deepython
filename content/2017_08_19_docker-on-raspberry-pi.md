*Raspberry Pi with Docker:* A Short Guide

For serving up my website [*Deep Python*](https://deepython.com) from a headless raspberry pi running in my apartment, I wanted to easily deploy docker containers to ensure the stability and scaleability of serving up my website. Here is what you need to do a similar setup:

1. Raspberry Pi with preferably at least 16gb of storage
2. A wifi adapter or ethernet cord
3. A keyboard, mouse, and monitor



Until next time,
