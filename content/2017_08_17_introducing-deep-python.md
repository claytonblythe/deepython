## *Deep Python:* A Christening
Python: *A large heavy-bodied nonvenomous constrictor snake occurring throughout the Old World tropics.*

...Sorry to get your hopes up, but this won't be a discussion about snakes nor our reptilian overlords that run the U.S government.

Rather, this is the first post of my new blog called [*Deep Python*](http://deepython.com). I am writing this blog as a hobby, as I begin my own personal learning adventure and career in the area of neural networks, deep learning, and
artificial intelligence. I plan to use this as an outreach avenue, but also as a knowledge repository for myself and others to use.

Just so you know what's to come, the blog will cover a wider array of topics that contribute toward the projects that I take on, and I might even write about some miscellaneous topics as well. I imagine that I will cover relevant topics like [Python](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Python_programming_language), [Pytorch](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Torch_machine_learning), [TensorFlow](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/TensorFlow), [Linux](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Linux), [Spark](https://www.google.com/search?q=pyspark&oq=pyspark&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.750j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), [Git](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Git), [Vulpix](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Vulpix_Pok%C3%A9mon) and [Docker](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Docker_software)...Now which one of those was a pokemon? Joking aside, don't be surprised at the occasional excursion into economics, current news, and personal finance.

Anyways, I think that is long enough for my first post. I'll keep it short and sweet, but I have quite a few ideas for posts to come!

Feel free to send me an email at [claytondblythe@gmail.com](mailto:claytondblythe@gmail.com) if you have ideas for projects, posts, or suggestions for improvement.


Until next time,
